While using a Unix shell, you may have already become familiar with a simple form of regular 
expression. Have you ever used a command like this?
~~~
ls *.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}
It's a searchable pattern that means "match anything that ends in .txt".
The * works as a wildcard, expanding to match *any* zero or more characters.
